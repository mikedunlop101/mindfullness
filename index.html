                    <hr>
                <p >Mindfulness is a technique used by millions of people to control how they feel about themselves.
                    Its core benefit is the practicing person can concentrate on the here and now. Essentially what is going on now and chanelling ones feelings
                    so that external influences dont negatively affect or have detrimental consequences. Its basically a form of meditation.
                    Doing Mindfulness includes breathing exercises, guided meditations and stress reduction relaxation.Mindfulness can be practiced using thought processes but can also
                    be used with the aid of a prop like a video with relaxing mindfulness music. I personally like videos and i will be putting the 
                    providing a link to a great source of a free relaxing video.
