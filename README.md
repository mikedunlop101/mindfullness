Welcome mikedunlop101,

MY Mindfullness Project

The purpose of this project is to create a self help website for mindfulness for the local community of Swindon. It is a relatively simple site, but the emphasis is that active mindfulness aware people can have a readily available resourse based in their local area. The intention is to include some self administered music and mindfulness videos on the about_us page. A table with meeting dates will be made available on the about_us page so that active mindfulness people can meet up on a regular basis and share their stories and hopefully support each other.

Strategy

The aim is to build a relevant website that adds to the existing community of mindfulness websites that are currently on the Net. The website will be based on research 
of information currently available on well known sites. This site aims to be different in that it is completely free and does not generate a income. Though donations towards it's upkeep are welcome. The main focus will be B 2 C, as its the ordinary persons struggling through life who will benefit the most. There is a opportunity that a community can be developed from a self help group that will be created within the website. The website will be managed by Michael Dunlop on a voluntary basis.

Scope Plane

After some consultation with friends and family and within keeping in line with the already documented strategy this site will be fairly simple in design with a minimum amout of documentation, but enough to make all its objectives clear. There will be due consideration for what the user needs, what they dont need and what they dont know that they need. Within the scope of this project the project will conform to W3C and CSS standards and will be easy for the user to navigate with or without impaired vision.




The Structure Plane

The design shall be consistent through out the web site with the design structure being very closely aligned between the pages. Navigation will be predictable and events will happen as the user expects, such as hyper links between pages. Information will be presented in a clear way so that the user learns through their experience of the web site. It will be visually pleasing to the eye with attractive images and video links. Users will get the opportunity to subscribe and join a database of like minded individuals who will be able to register for events and coffee meets in the local area. Users will never be more than three clicks away from where they need to navigate too.

Skeleton Plane

The site will be compliant with visual conventions and the user experience will get what they need when they want it. It is generally accepted that for most users the system is the UI, they will assess the value of the site by what they see. The site will initially consist of three pages packed full of information and will be compliant with different screen sizes, such as mobile phones and tablets.

Surface Plane

The user experience will provide a visual language that is easy on the eye. the site will provide interesting and attractive color. The content will be progressively presented such as color contrasts, font contrasts and the header and footer will be consistent. users will be able to access audio and visual content
and through its feedback facility will be able to grow with updated material on a weekly basis.

Documentation of Mindfullness website creation (how it was created and updated)
 
The first task i performed was to create a template for git pod use. Once that was completed i created a index.html file and saved it. I needed a guide to set up my file structure so i viewed some videos from the love running web site creation. i acknowledge observing the creation of the site structure from love running, but put my own stamp on it. i want my website to be different, however love running has some great techniques that can be borrowed. Like i said though ive put my own creativity to it and will minimumise taking code from love running and copy and pasting it. This is my own work. Now i have my site structure in place i will look to add elements that are not in love running, and are completely my own work.

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. 

I obtained my mindfulness-image.jpg from https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=free+mindfulness+images .
background image for sign up form was obtained from https://www.google.com/search?q=background+mindfulness+images&client=firefox-b-d&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=0VaTMb8-fVqBAM%252Cd9YMEWS2ltOIoM%252C_%253BX8aPN8znMn8vaM%252CW0K1LHqAjaYYSM%252C_%253B-kPDLdJ6mlRwQM%252CbnVimVxlqjL7uM%252C_%253B_QMrAvJ3WEF9NM%252C5lSMAQ3cQDsmsM%252C_%253BPzRXsGfI3I3SwM%252CVj-LG71xNghXXM%252C_%253BuwWPkZg_Gfa0XM%252CbnVimVxlqjL7uM%252C_%253B3tsRzTOZqp5XEM%252CbgSx-jmh5ZoCxM%252C_%253B28XzOExTmkr_5M%252CczSOBlFDzc5gvM%252C_%253Bbp_Ti1HaDqjjZM%252C5lSMAQ3cQDsmsM%252C_%253BryAsjKGtUbRytM%252CVj-LG71xNghXXM%252C_%253B9SXk02OxxKi37M%252C-pk5ggifZ_itfM%252C_%253B_1DgIBa9wIfISM%252C-pk5ggifZ_itfM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kQ42SD_JgeUTV6oagKZNOX9U1xJVQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp_Mz1lvLzAhWQT8AKHdLxCVYQ9QF6BAgFEAE&biw=1536&bih=711&dpr=1.25#imgrc=9SXk02OxxKi37M

two more images were obtained from the same website linked above. I then added background images via css

I completed the sign_up page by using the work i had done on love running as a starting point. The code was my own, so i dont see it as plagurism and it has been changed to reflect a fresh stamp of creativity. I added a new background image that was very befitting for a mindfulness website. https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mindfulness. This images change regularly so you may not see mine there.

I then added a created by notice to the bottom of my web pages. i found i was unable to use the same piece of code for all pages, so had to seperately format them to fit at the centre bottom of each page.

i also added a table to about us, informing readers of upcoming mindfullness events for November and December of this year.
below the table i copied and pasted a video link with a inbedded video on mindfullness <iframe width="600" height="470" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AapsmyVBinA" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>. This code was copied straight from its source https://mindfulnessexercises.com/self-discipline-through-mindfulness-how-to-become-more-disciplined/. 

i then added semantics to the sign-up page, namely fieldset and legend. This was done to aid accessability for people who might otherwise find it difficult to use the form.

I did some work on the screen sizes and ran into some difficulties. The images were working to a certain extent, but i found it difficult to get them how i wanted. i decided to ask my mentor when i next meet with him in a weeks time. Next on my list was to validate my HTML code through the W 3C Valdidator service. I had to make a few minor changes but my code was basically clean. I did the same for CSS code validation.


Basically the index.html page was built up by using trial and error. I based my navigation code on the love running website, but as i grew more confident used display: flex; to align my navigation. the navigation html was added as follows.

<body>
    <header>
        <div>
        <a href="index.html">
            <h1 id="main_heading">Mindfulness in Swindon</h1>
        </a>
       <nav>
            <ul id="navigation_links">
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="about-us.html">Videos</a></li>
                <li><a href="sign-up.html">Sign Up</a></li>
            </ul>
            

        </nav>
        </div>
    </header>

    The navigation html code also needed styling with CSS. which i used the following code for.
#main_heading,
#navigation_links {
    line-height: 80px;
}

#navigation_links {
    font-size: 125%;
    text-rendering: geometricPrecision;
    display:flex;
    justify-content:flex-end;
    flex-direction: row;
    margin-top: auto;
}

#navigation_links li {
    list-style-type: none;
    margin-right: 25px;
}

#navigation_links a {
    text-decoration: none;
}

I then added some introductory text into the subject of mindfulness and centered it within the html page. the code used for this was as follows.

<section id="mindfulness-block">
           <div> 
            
                
            </div>
                
            <div class="center-text">

                <div class="text-block"><h2><span>What is Mindfulness</span></h2> 
                    <hr>
                <p >Mindfulness is a technique used by millions of people to control how they feel about themselves.
                    Its core benefit is the practicing person can concentrate on the here and now. Essentially what is going on now and chanelling ones feelings
                    so that external influences dont negatively affect or have detrimental consequences. Its basically a form of meditation.
                    Doing Mindfulness includes breathing exercises, guided meditations and stress reduction relaxation.Mindfulness can be practiced using thought processes but can also
                    be used with the aid of a prop like a video with relaxing mindfulness music. I personally like videos and i will be putting the 
                    providing a link to a great source of a free relaxing video.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    <h2>Aim Of This website</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The aim of this website is to empower you to take the steps you need to learn mindfulness. Perhaps even teachig it to others.
                        Helping the Swindon community. the main NHS system is overwhelmed dealing with Covid 19, so we must do it for ourselves and help each other.
                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>


This css coding for this was as follows

.center-text {
    text-align: center;}
    
This was followed by three images that were floated to the right. the html code is added below

<div id="images">
            <img src="assets/images/mindfulness-image.jpg" alt="mindfulness image" id="mindfulness-image" >
            
            <img src="assets/images/mindfulness2.jpg" alt="mindfulness with tea" id="mindfulness2">
            
            <img src="assets/images/mildfundnes.jpg" alt="mindfulness image" id="mildfundnes">
            

        </div>

and the css was

#images {
    float:right;
   
}

#mindfulness-image {
    width: 450px;
    height: 350px;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 10%;
    border-color: #000;
    

}

#mindfulness2 {
    width: 450px;
    height: 350px;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 10%;
    border-color: #000;
}

#mildfundnes {
    width: 450px;
    height: 350px;
    float:right;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 10%;
    border-color: #000;


}

the next thing i did was add some more text to the bottom right handside of the index.html web page. This text was css styled as follows.

#lower-right-text {
    padding-top: 45px;
    float: right;
    width: 40%;
}

Lastly i created a footer that said created by Michael Dunlop. i did originally put a copyright notice up, but on advise from my mentor i removed it and replaced it with the above text. i also added a awesome font, representing a heart. the html was as follows.

<footer class="footer-bottom"> <p><i class="fas fa-heart">Created by Michael Dunlop</i></p>
        
    
    
    </footer>
    <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/b83175b9a4.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


the css used for this was as follows.

.footer-bottom {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-end;
    justify-content: center;
    padding-left: 40%;
}
.footer-bottom p{
    padding-top: 440px;
    text-align: right;
    margin: 0 auto;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    color: #000;
    font-size: 1.3rem;


}

that completes the index page of my website.





![index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikedunlop101/mindfullness/main/documentation/screenshots/Picture1.png)

Work on the about-us webpage began with copying and pasting the navigation elements of index.html. The code can be seen in the index.html section above in this readme file.

a table was added and used because its a good structural way to group data together for meaningful purposes. The html code used was as follows.

<section id="about-us-title"> <h3>We Meet Regularaly</h3><table-caption>Why Not Join One Of Our Events</table-caption>
        <!--add table-->
        <div class="table-style">
            <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Introduction</th>
                  <th>Event</th>
                  <th>Date</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><span>Anybody who lives in the Swindon area has a opportunity to
                      develop their mindfulness skills and to become a practicing instructor
                  </span></td>
                  <td><span>Toothill community centre</span></td>
                  <td><span>Every Sunday 11 am during Novemeber and December 2021</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><span>Coffee evening and A Chance to get together to exchange experiences </span></td>
                  <td><span>Costa Coffee in West Swindon</span></td>
                  <td><span>Every Friday 7pm during November and December</span></td>
                </tr>
              </table> 




        </div>

Some styling was also included and that was added using CSS, which was as follows.

 .table-style {
        width: 600px;
        height:max-content;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: flex-start;
        margin: 0 auto;

        
    }


A Iframe mindfulness video was also added below the table. this was added to give members of the website a taste of mindfulness. the intention is to regularly change the video and to keep subscribers well informed in useful ways to meditate in a mindfulness state. . The html used for this was as follows.

 <div class="video">
            <iframe width="600" height="470" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AapsmyVBinA" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


        </div>

some css styling was also added to the mindfulness video.

.video {
     display:flex;
     justify-content: center;
     align-items:center;
     height: 180vh;
     
    }   
.video iframe {
    margin-bottom: 60%;
    
}

that concludes the about-us web page.

       



![about-us.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikedunlop101/mindfullness/d3283d3b9ef28079952ebccea5bc78e38f815a6a/documentation/screenshots/Picture2.png)



Lastly the sign-up page was designed using a warm background image of peace and tranquility and with a form that people could sign up to for future news and events. there is a check box that enables those who register to subscribe to a newsletter that will be sent to their email address. the html code used for the sign up page is as follows.

 <section class="opt_in_form">
        <form method="POST" action="https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/" class="register">
            <fieldset><legend><h2>Join Swindon Mindfulness Group</h2></legend>
        <label for="first_name">First Name</label>
        <input id="first_name" name="first_name" type="text" class="text" required>
        
        <label for="last_name">Last Name</label>
        <input id="last_name" name="last_name" type="text" class="text" required>
        
        <label for="email">Email Address</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email_address" class="text" required>
        
        <label for="opt_in">Opt in for newsletters</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="opt_in" name="opt_in" >
        </fieldset>
        
        <input class="opt_in" type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form></section>

The css used was as follows.

.register {

    margin: 10% 10% 0 0;
    color: #fff;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: 700;
    max-width: 450px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 15%;
    padding: 35px;

}

.register h2 {
    color: rgb(12, 11, 11);
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}

/*form elements styling */
.text {
    width: 100%;
    height: 30px;
    margin: 10px 0 25px 0;
    font-weight: bold;
}

#opt_in {
    margin-top: 20px;
    padding: 12px 30px 12px 30px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 110%;
    background-color: blueviolet;
    color: #fff;
    display: block;
}

#opt_in:hover {
    background-color: blueviolet;
    color: #fff;
}

The footer (created by Michael Dunlop) was lastly added with the following CSS code
#footer-bottom-sign-up {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    width: auto; 
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    color:#fff;
    font-size: 1.3rem;
    padding-bottom: 83%;}

Last thing on my website was to create css for the allowance of different screen sizes. This mostly worked well, but the presentation of the smaller screens proved to be challenging. I made a best effort using the following CSS code that originated from Love running but was then changed to suit my particular website

 @media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
         #mindfulness-block {
             width: 65%;
             height: 1200px;
             margin: 0 auto;
         } 
         html, body {
            height: 1200px;
            font-family: arial, sans-serif;
            clear: left;
            background: url("../images/background-image2.jpg") no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: center;
            } 
         
         #images {
             padding: 2rem 0.0rem;
             margin: 0 auto;
         } 
         #mindfulness-image, #mindfulness2, #mildfundnes {
             width: 31%;
             float: left;
             padding: 0.2rem;
             margin: 0 auto;

         }
         #lower-right-text {
             width: 100%;
             float: left;
             padding: 0rem;
             
         }
         .footer-bottom p {
            display:flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: flex-end;

             }

             
        }

        @media screen and (max-width: 950px) {

        #main_heading,

        }
        #mindfulness-image, #mindfulness2, #mildfundnes {
            width: 90%;
            height: 400px;
            margin:auto;
        }
        .table-style {
                width: 90%;
                float: left;
                padding: 0.2rem;
                margin: 0 auto;   
             }  
             .video {
                width: 90%;
                float: left;
                padding: 0.2rem;

             }
             
             
        }

        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {

            #main_heading,
            #navigation_links {

            margin-bottom: 1.0rem;
            line-height: 1.0rem;
            
            }
            #mindfulness-image, #mindfulness2, #mildfundnes {
                width: 90%;
                height: 100%;
                margin:auto;
            }
            .table-style {

                    margin: 0 auto;   
                 }

            }

TESTING

Run through The pages and ensure all links work..... All pages hyper link correctly
Run Website on different screen sizes.... This partially works. the website is fine on my 15 inch laptop and large extended screen. There are some problems with running the website on mobile device screen sizes. Particularly the footer message. it floats all over the page and i have been unable to put it right.
check image alt scripts are running correctly. i did this by distorting the image addresses to force up the alt image messages. alt messages display correctly.
test the sign up form. input relevant data into form inputs and press submit. Form works well
test form with unexpected data entry including incorrect email address. result is a pop up message saying a recognised email format is required.
test form first name. So long as characters are input the form accepts entry on submittion. same is the case with last name. This is a area for future development using javascript.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
